## Phase One
The game starts with loading your Realm of size 250x100 cells. Each cell is capable of holding a structure of some kind. Crops are usually of size 1x1, some buildings are 3x3 and higher.

However, at the beginning you'll only have a space of size 50x50 cells available to you. The rest of your Realm is flooded with environment, and other objects you need to get rid of in order to be able to use that space.

You are given a certain amount of basic currency and materials to build your first Production building, which will help you create these materials by yourself, so you can comfortably craft necessities on your own, clean up the Environment and progress in the game.

Doing these first actions also complete your Tasks, which give you variety of rewards such as Currency (Gold Bar, Gold Coin, Diamonds), valuable materials, Loot Boxes etc. So make sure to claim your rewards whenever possible.

Your goal is to expand your Realm as much as you possibly can. Gather resources and prepare for Phase Two where you will utilize your gathered Materials, Gemstones, Elixirs and others for gearing up your Pets, Adventurers and Farmers.
