## Merchant
Merchant shows up at your Realm every 6 hours (based on the time you first loaded your Realm). This entity will have all types of items for sale, however the chances of it having a Key for sale is significantly lower compared to having a Material for sale.

Realm Vibe points will increase the chances of a Merchant to possess more valuable Items and also dictates the size of a price discount. Currency that the Merchant will accept for each individual Item is selected randomly by the algorithm, as well as the price per Item.
Each Item has a Min-Max range for each Currency.

Example:
Cinnamon Bun
<ul>
	<li>-Gold Coin (100-200) per Item</li>
	<li>-Gold Bar (5-15) per Item</li>
	<li>-Diamond (1-5) per Item</li>
</ul>
	

Merchant will also have offers to buy Items from you for a randomly selected Currency, at a price calculated from the Min-Max range. So if you end up in a situation where you have a bunch of Clay Bricks but not enough Diamonds, the merchant may help.
