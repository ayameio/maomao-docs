## Future of maomao
<img src="\assets\images\icons\future.png" width="256" height="256">
I will share with you a few ideas that I have in my mind when it comes to extending the game limitlessly.. and I'm not playing small here.

### Economy

Players being able to trade Items and Characters between each other for in-game Currency or maomao token. I really want to reward players that grind hard. When Diablo 3 came out, it was awesome to make cash with real money auction house. I will do my best to bring this to Web3.

### Content

I designed the gameplay to be less repetitive and give players freedom to choose the aspect of the game they want to engage with. Do you like Farming Dungeons more than Harvesting Crops? Feel free to do so. Both aspects of the game are equally rewarding, but in slightly different ways. Anyways, it's always smart to engage in everything.

New content will come in many forms. New items, buildings, crafting systems and variety of gameplay modes will be continuously introduced. I'd like to make a mix of Tycoon - Auto Battle - Turn based - Tower Defense modes in the game. 

I already have these things laid out on paper, it's not just a thought in aether.

### Community Realms

This one is something I really have to think through, but here's the gist.

Communities should be able to create their own Realm and members will be able to interact with unique instance of it, but all the data containing the upgrades made inside the DAO Realm is shared amongst members, and the bonuses provided by these upgrades will affect your own individual Realm.

Simply put, it's pretty much like having a guild, and it's members gain bonuses by cumulatively upgrading the guild structures.

Community artists may design their own Buildings which will be added into the game and members will be able to place these Buildings inside of their own Realm. It should be as easy as making a pull request on Github.

I will provide guidelines for creation of these assets later on.


### Tools

Development of in-house tools for faster game development, testing, optimization of progression curves and content creation is very important. There are no general use case tools available to me.

Developing a custom code testing kit that would fit my needs is a different task (since I use multiple programming languages), as well as optimizing the game progression curve which involves a deep understanding of what exactly in the game feels fast/slow, easy/hard/impossible or fun/boring... and translating that information into numbers.

Once our fundamental in-house tools are established, we can infinitely scale the game and become a content machine.


## This concludes my plan for the nearest future. It took me a few days to write this whole website, thank you so much for reading.
