## Augmentation
Augmentation of an item is a process of sacrificing a Gemstone and an Scroll of Augmentation in order to increase its attributes by 10% of its base values. Augmentation will increase all attributes on the item.

We know that an item can roll its attribute values from a min-max range.
For example, if you have an item that has a range of attribute values 1500-2500 and your rolled value is 1800, augmenting an item will add only 180.

You can augment your items infinitely, however, failing an augmentation will destroy all your augments.

The higher +(number) augments is, the lower the chance to succeed an augmentation process.
