## Production

Producing items is one of the fundamental blocks of the game and it's progression.

Every production has X amount of recipes. Starting with the lowest Rarity (E), up to the Rarity (A).

Producing goods of Rarity (E) only costs X amount of Gold Coins

Producing goods of one Rarity higher, costs X amount of Gold Coins + X amount of two items one Rarity lower.

For example:
Item of Rarity (A) will cost:
	-5000 of Gold Coins
	-50 of some item of Rarity (B) (usually obtainable by producing one lower Rarity item in the same Production)
	-150 of some item of Rarity (B) (some arbitrary item obtainable anywhere)

This pattern is repeated throughout most of the Producing part of the game. There may be exceptions to this rule of course.

There are two types of items you can produce, Goods and Materials. 
Goods are produced by combining Materials. Materials are produced with Gold Coins.
It takes a certain amount of time to produce the desired item. All buildings that produce items have up to 8 producing slots, always having 3 slots unlocked by default and the rest is unlockable.
