## Screenshots

Here's a few screenshots from development!

### Building Shop Screenshot
Here's a simple Building Shop menu. As you can see, each building has it's own name, size, building time, vibe points and cost.
Every building belongs to a specific category, based on it's purpose.

### Realm Screenshot
Here you can see a base view of your Realm. It's practically a grid of 250x150 cells, but almost completely empty. :D
I took this screenshot only for simple demonstration purposes.

### Crafting Screenshot
Every building that is able to produce something (except Idle buildings), have their own UI of this kind.
The UI is filled with recipes and production slots.
