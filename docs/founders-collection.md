No grinding for whitelists. Simply, I want to do things my way.

Founders benefits
	Early access to new content and access to beta-test phases
	Loot Box airdrops
	Random starter pack Loot
	and others...

Funds distribution
	30% maomao token LP
	60% project development
	10% airdrops to Founders Collection holders
		- Meaning, 10% of what each collection makes, will be distributed amongst founders.

This distribution scheme will be followed with each upcoming collection.

maomao future Token distribution
	25% treasury
	75% airdrop

Honestly, I might go for 95% airdrop, I don't really care.

Each piece of maomao Founders or maomao Realm collection have it's own .dat file that stores game progression. By transferring these tokens, you also transfer the game data.
This way, players may be able to make money, if they manage to find a buyer that does not want to play from the start.

Other pieces of the game content will have it's own token collection. Such as special loot boxes. If you're lucky enough to find one, you'll be prompted to mint the loot box token, which you may sell, or burn to get the loot.
