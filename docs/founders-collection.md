To qualify for the maomao token airdrop, collect collectibles I drop on DRiP, or get a maomao Founders Collection NFT. The more collectibles you own, more tokens you get.

Each piece of maomao Founders or maomao Realm collection have it's own .dat file that stores game progression. By transferring the token, you also transfer the game data.
This way, players may be able to make money, if they manage to find a buyer that does not want to play from the start.

Other pieces of the game content will have it's own token collection. Such as special loot boxes. If you're lucky enough to find one, you'll be prompted to mint the loot box token, which you may sell, or burn to get the loot.
